# Maybe Not
Back in 2018, Rich Hickey's [Maybe Not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug) sparked debate in the team I was working in at the time. It caused us to reevaluate many of the positions we had previously taking to both types and API design. It also clarified an underlying issue that we had been battling for a long time, namely what type theoretic constructs are appropriate to use across API boundaries to minimize coupling.

A while later, I began seeing many comments on Hacker News and Reddit that were critical of Rich's talk. These critiques claimed Rich does not understand (or even seems to hate) type systems and Haskell. I think critique and debate is great, but these comments all seemed to miss the underlying point. It's understandable that they missed the point, I had to personally rewatch the talk several types to really begin to understand it. `Maybe Not` is not an attack on Haskell. It is not meant to deride type systems. This is a talk about minimizing coupling and enabling compatible growth. 

## Compatible Changes
Software is almost never written in isolation. The functions and interfaces you write will end up being used by some other programmer. That other programmer could be you in the future, someone on your team, or someone on the other side of the world that you will never meet or even talk to. 


To understand Rich's position on this subject, I recommend watching his [Spec-ulation Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk).


I think critique is great, but nearly all of these comments seemed to have missed the point. 

I think critique is great, but nearly all of these comments seemed misguided. 

talk become a hot topic of debate in my team. 

seems to me to be Rich Hickey's most misunderstood talk. 

I am guilty of this too - I had to watch it many times to understand it.
